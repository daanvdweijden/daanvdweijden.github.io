I am a computer science PhD student with a passion for using technology to improve democratic decision-making processes. My research focuses on the use of artificial intelligence and natural language processing in digital deliberative democracy, where citizens come together to discuss and make decisions through online platforms. With my expertise in these fields, I am dedicated to creating innovative solutions that can help people engage in more meaningful and effective democratic discourse.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of XYZ. This laid the foundation for my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the same institution, where I developed a deep understanding of natural language processing and machine learning. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on digital deliberative democracy, where I am working to push the boundaries of what is possible in this exciting field.

Throughout my academic career, I have been committed to using technology for the greater good. I believe that artificial intelligence and natural language processing can be powerful tools for improving democratic decision-making processes and ensuring that citizens have a stronger voice in the political process. I am excited about the potential of these technologies and am eager to continue exploring their applications in the field of digital deliberative democracy.
